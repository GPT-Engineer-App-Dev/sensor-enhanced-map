I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create image files or any other type of binary files. However, I can guide you through the process of creating a map pin icon using an image editing software or provide you with a description of how it could look.

If you want to create a map pin icon, you can follow these general steps using an image editing software like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or an online editor like Canva:

1. Open your image editing software and create a new file. For a web icon, a canvas size of 256x256 pixels is a good starting point for high resolution, and you can scale it down later for use on the web.

2. Choose a simple and bold color for your pin that will stand out on a map. Red is a common choice because it's eye-catching.

3. Use the shape tool to draw the pin's head. This is typically an elongated oval or teardrop shape. You can start by drawing a circle and then pulling the bottom point down to create the teardrop shape.

4. Draw the pin's body. This is usually a rectangle or a slightly wider shape at the top that narrows down to a point at the bottom, positioned centrally beneath the pin's head.

5. Combine the head and body layers to create the complete pin shape.

6. Add a white shine or highlight to the upper part of the pin's head to give it a three-dimensional effect. This can be done by adding an elliptical shape with a white gradient that fades into transparency.

7. Save your icon. If you're using it for the web, you'll want to export it as a PNG file to preserve the transparency. Make sure to save the original in a format that preserves layers (like PSD for Photoshop) in case you need to edit it later.

8. Resize the image to the desired dimensions for use on your map or website. Common sizes for icons are 32x32, 64x64, and 128x128 pixels.

Remember, this is a text description of the process. To actually create the file, you'll need to use image editing software. If you need a visual example, you can find many tutorials online that will show you step-by-step how to create a pin icon.
